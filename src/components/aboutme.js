      <h2>I've recently completed an intense six-month Full Stack Web Development program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I'm looking to hit the ground running following the completion of the program and find employment as a highly creative and function focused developer who enjoys designing front end applications but is eager to continue learning and finding success working on the back end as well. With a highly competitive work ethic and drive to excel at every task, with experience problem solving and delegation on the fly, I can be an excellent addition to any team.</h2>
